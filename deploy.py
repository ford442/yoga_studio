project_deploy_template.py

Copy this file into your project as `deploy.py` (or deploy_contabo.py).
Customize the constants at the top for your project.

Usage:
  1. Build your project:  npm run build   (or python build, etc.)
  2. python deploy.py

This script contacts https://storage.noahcohn.com (your Contabo storage manager)
to upload each file in the build directory.

The actual upload to storage.1ink.us happens server-side using credentials
that live ONLY in the Contabo VPS .env file — no passwords in this repo.

Requirements:
  pip install requests
